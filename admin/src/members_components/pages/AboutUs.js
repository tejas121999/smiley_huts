                Smiley Huts started with a passion to provide a warm and comfortable experience for all travelers across Canada.
                In the world of ever increasing expenses, some dreams of traveling and exploring new places never become reality.
                We imagined a world where people would stay wherever they go happily and the only thing they worry about is taking the best possible photograph and capturing the moment.
                We are very young and extremely motivated to provide the best service in North America.While we look to add more locations each month,
                we also ensure to provide the best experience for every stay. Come join us in this journey.
